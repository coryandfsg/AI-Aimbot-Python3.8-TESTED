## üß† Features

- AI-powered aim detection using OpenCV + YOLO  
- Target locking with configurable FOV and sensitivity  
- Simulated input via Python-based mouse control  
- FPS-like UI overlay to visualize targets and hits  
- Works with recorded gameplay or custom test environments  
- Modular code for experimentation or academic use

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The tool processes video frames using a pre-trained YOLOv5 object detection model.
2. It identifies player targets in the scene based on bounding boxes.
3. Calculates distance-to-center and prioritizes nearest target.
4. Simulates smooth mouse movement toward the target (non-intrusive).
5. Optionally draws bounding boxes and tracking vectors on screen.
